  <h1><a id="doubledown"></a>DoubleDown</h1>
  <definition><p>DoubleDown aims to be a simple, structured and extensible, plain-text
markup language.</p></definition>
  <p><b>Note:</b> This document is itself written using DoubleDown;
you can <a href="doubledown.dbl.txt">see the source for it here</a>.</p>
  <h2><a id="philosophy"></a>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>There would be no DoubleDown without <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber's Markdown</a>
lighting the way. Markdown's syntax allows writing machine-processable
documents, while still remaining readable. Indeed, that philosophy is
clearly stated by John up-front:</p>
  <quote><p>The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make
it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</p></quote>
  <p>As great as Markdown is, there are times when its design gets in the way of
what you want to do. Maybe you want some conditional text. Maybe you need a
special kind of paragraph; a sidebar for instance. Maybe you want to include
some comments which should not show up in the final output. Maybe you want to
do citations and have a bibliography at the end. Or a table-of-contents at the
start.</p>
  <p>Yes, you can fix most everything by including raw HTML in a Markdown document.
But if HTML is anything, readable is not high on its list of attributes. And so
it detracts from Markdown's overriding design goal.</p>
  <p>In addition, HTML may not be the type of output we want. If you want to write
a paper, or a book, you're most likely targeting PDF instead.</p>
  <p>So here I offer DoubleDown as an alternative. It tries to stick to Markdown's
overall design goal of readability, retaining some of its best ideas, while
also balancing some extra constraints:<ul>
    <li><span>Have only one way to do any one thing.</span></li>
    <li><span>Do not tie any of its syntax to a specific output format.</span></li>
    <li><span>Make it possible/easy to add in useful extensions.</span></li>
  </ul></p>
  <h2><a id="blocks"></a>Blocks</h2>
  <p>DoubleDown documents are made up of discrete blocks of text. The first and
foremost thing to understand about DoubleDown's syntax is precisely what makes
up an individual block.</p>
  <definition><p>A block is a sequence of one or more lines.
Any two lines in a document are part of the same block, <b>unless</b>:</p><ul>
    <li><span>they are <i>separated by a blank line</i>, or</span></li>
    <li><span>they are <i>indented differently</i>.</span></li>
  </ul></definition>
  <p>The idea of using blank lines to separate blocks of text comes straight from
Markdown, and it's a great one. It makes for a very readable raw document.</p>
  <p>The idea of using indentation to separate blocks, however, is not a Markdown
concept. The inspiration here comes from programming languages like Python.
It is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule">off-side rule</a>, and it adds a hierarchical
structure to blocks, which will let us do some creative things while keeping
the actual text readable.</p>
  <p>The logical tree structure will, of course, match the tree structure as it
visually appears in the document. That is, blocks are ordered as found in the
document. So if one block appears before another in the text, then it will
precede that block in the tree. If one block is indented below another in the
text then it will appear as descendent of that block in the tree.</p>
  <definition><p>The parent of any block is the closest preceding block whose indentation is
lower than the current one. If no such block exists then the block is a
"root" block.</p></definition>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <code><pre>The quick
  brown fox
    jumped over
  the lazy
    dog.</pre></code>
  <p>The hierarchy for this would match:</p>
  <result><ul>
    <li><span>The quick</span><ul>
      <li><span>brown fox</span><ul>
        <li><span>jumped over</span></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><span>the lazy</span><ul>
        <li><span>dog.</span></li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></result>
  <h2><a id="block-types"></a>Block types</h2>
  <p>DoubleDown blocks get categorized into one of different types, the most basic
of which is just a chunk of text, or "paragraph". But there also headings,
lists, tables, and others.</p>
  <p>Any block should be of only one kind. So you should not mix a list into a
heading, for instance. Keep separate things in separate blocks. While this may
sound (overly ?) restrictive, it helps readability, simplifies the formatting
rules, and just makes processing DoubleDown documents easier.</p>
  <h3><a id="paragraphs"></a>Paragraphs</h3>
  <p>When a block is not recognized as any specific type, it gets marked as being a
paragraph. This is just a generic block of text, and is what makes up most
documents (including this one).</p>
  <h3><a id="headings"></a>Headings</h3>
  <p>A block which starts with a sequence of one or more hash characters (<inline-code>#</inline-code>),
followed by whitespace, is considered a heading. For example:</p>
  <code><pre># This is a top-level heading

## This is a sub-heading

########## What level heading are we at ?</pre></code>
  <p>It is ok to split the heading over multiple lines, if that's more convenient.</p>
  <code><pre># The nucleotide sequence of a 3.2 kb segment of mitochondrial maxicircle
DNA from Crithidia fasciculata containing the gene for cytochrome oxidase
subunit III, the N-terminal part of the apocytochrome b gene and a
possible frameshift gene; further evidence for the use of unusual
initiator triplets in trypanosome mitochondria</pre></code>
  <h3><a id="ordered-lists"></a>Ordered lists</h3>
  <p>A block where the first line starts with an asterisk (<inline-code>*</inline-code>), followed by
whitespace, is considered a list. Each further line which starts in the same
way adds another item to the list. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>* Once upon a midnight dreary,
* while I pondered,
weak and weary,
* Over many a quaint
and curious volume
of forgotten lore</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><ul>
    <li><span>Once upon a midnight dreary,</span></li>
    <li><span>while I pondered,
weak and weary,</span></li>
    <li><span>Over many a quaint
and curious volume
of forgotten lore</span></li>
  </ul></result>
  <p>When one list block follows another at the same level of indentation, they are
considered to be part of the same list. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>* Once upon a midnight dreary,

* while I pondered,
weak and weary,

* Over many a quaint
and curious volume
of forgotten lore</pre></code>
  <p>Despite being three distinct list blocks, DoubleDown will treat this as just a
single list. This is needed for doing nested lists. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>* Fruit
    * Apples
    * Oranges
* Vegetables
    * Tomatoes
    * Carrots</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><ul>
    <li><span>Fruit</span><ul>
      <li><span>Apples</span></li>
      <li><span>Oranges</span></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><span>Vegetables</span><ul>
      <li><span>Tomatoes</span></li>
      <li><span>Carrots</span></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></result>
  <p>This also allows for lists with more elaborate content in their items. For
example:</p>
  <code><pre>* Lorem Ipsum
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
    veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
    commodo consequat.
* Fibonacci
    [code javascript]
        &gt; function fibonacci(n) {
        &gt;     if (n &lt;= 1) return 1;
        &gt;     return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
        &gt; }</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><ul>
    <li><span>Lorem Ipsum</span><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
commodo consequat.</p></li>
    <li><span>Fibonacci</span><code><pre>function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n &lt;= 1) return 1;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}</pre></code></li>
  </ul></result>
  <h3><a id="numbered-lists"></a>Numbered lists</h3>
  <p>A block where each line starts with a number, followed by a period (<inline-code>.</inline-code>), and
again followed by whitespace, is considered a numbered list. Each further line
which starts in the same way adds another item to the list. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>1. Once upon a midnight dreary,
2. while I pondered,
weak and weary,
3. Over many a quaint
and curious volume
of forgotten lore</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><ol>
    <li><span>Once upon a midnight dreary,</span></li>
    <li><span>while I pondered,
weak and weary,</span></li>
    <li><span>Over many a quaint
and curious volume
of forgotten lore</span></li>
  </ol></result>
  <p>List numbers need not be in order, sequential, or even unique. So the following
example will give the exact same result.</p>
  <code><pre>0. Once upon a midnight dreary,
0. while I pondered,
weak and weary,
0. Over many a quaint
and curious volume
of forgotten lore</pre></code>
  <p>When one numbered list block follows another at the same level of indentation,
they are considered to be part of the same list. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>1. Once upon a midnight dreary,

2. while I pondered,
weak and weary,

3. Over many a quaint
and curious volume
of forgotten lore</pre></code>
  <p>Despite being three distinct list blocks, DoubleDown will treat this as just a
single list. This is needed for doing nested lists. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>1. Fruit
    1. Apples
    2. Oranges
2. Vegetables
    1. Tomatos
    2. Carrots</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><ol>
    <li><span>Fruit</span><ol>
      <li><span>Apples</span></li>
      <li><span>Oranges</span></li>
    </ol></li>
    <li><span>Vegetables</span><ol>
      <li><span>Tomatos</span></li>
      <li><span>Carrots</span></li>
    </ol></li>
  </ol></result>
  <p>This also allows for lists with more elaborate content in their items. For
example:</p>
  <code><pre>1. Lorem Ipsum
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
    veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
    commodo consequat.
2. Fibonacci
    [code javascript]
        &gt; function fibonacci(n) {
        &gt;     if (n &lt;= 1) return 1;
        &gt;     return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
        &gt; }</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><ol>
    <li><span>Lorem Ipsum</span><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
commodo consequat.</p></li>
    <li><span>Fibonacci</span><code><pre>function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n &lt;= 1) return 1;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}</pre></code></li>
  </ol></result>
  <h3><a id="tables"></a>Tables</h3>
  <p>A block where each line starts with a pipe (<inline-code>|</inline-code>), followed by whitespace, and
ends with a pipe, preceded by whitespace, is a considered a table. Each line
represents a row if that table. Columns can be created within a row by
separating them with pipes (these too with whitespace). For example:</p>
  <code><pre>| 8 | 1 | 6 |
| 3 | 5 | 7 |
| 4 | 9 | 2 |</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>7</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table></result>
  <p>When one table block follows another at the same level of indentation, they are
considered to be part of the same table. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>| 8 | 1 | 6 |

| 3 | 5 | 7 |

| 4 | 9 | 2 |</pre></code>
  <p>Despite being three distinct table blocks, DoubleDown will treat this as just a
single table.</p>
  <h3><a id="dictionaries"></a>Dictionaries</h3>
  <p>A block where each line starts with a dash (<inline-code>-</inline-code>), followed by whitespace, is
considered a dictionary, where each line defines a key and an associated value.
Key and value are separated by a colon (<inline-code>:</inline-code>), followed by whitespace. For
example:</p>
  <code><pre>- Title: DoubleDown
- PI: 3.14159265359...</pre></code>
  <p>When one dictionary block follows another at the same level of indentation,
they are considered to be part of the same dictionary. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>- Title: DoubleDown

- PI: 3.14159265359...</pre></code>
  <h3><a id="verbatim"></a>Verbatim</h3>
  <p>A block where each line starts with a greater-than sign (<inline-code>&gt;</inline-code>), followed by
whitespace, is considered a verbatim block. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>&gt; Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
&gt; Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
&gt;     While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
&gt; As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
&gt; “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
&gt;             Only this and nothing more.”</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><pre>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”</pre></result>
  <h3><a id="comments"></a>Comments</h3>
  <p>A block which starts with four forward slashes (<inline-code>////</inline-code>), followed by a
whitespace, is considered a comment. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>//// This is a comment.</pre></code>
  <p>It is ok to split the comment over multiple lines, if that's more convenient.</p>
  <code><pre>//// This is
a multi-line
comment.</pre></code>
  <h3><a id="horizontal-rule"></a>Horizontal rule</h3>
  <p>A sequence of three or more dashes (<inline-code>-</inline-code>) is considered a horizontal rule. For
example:</p>
  <code><pre>---</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><hr></hr></result>
  <h2><a id="inline-elements"></a>Inline elements</h2>
  <h3><a id="emphasis"></a>Emphasis</h3>
  <p>Any parts of text enclosed on either side by double underscores (<inline-code>__</inline-code>), or on
either side by double asterisks (<inline-code>**</inline-code>), is considered to have emphasis. For
example:</p>
  <code><pre>__Once__ upon a **midnight dreary**</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><p><i>Once</i> upon a <b>midnight dreary</b></p></result>
  <p>The text being enclosed can selection multiple lines, but not multiple blocks. For
example:</p>
  <code><pre>while I pondered, __weak
and weary__,</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><p>while I pondered, <i>weak
and weary</i>,</p></result>
  <p>Both forms of emphasis may be combined. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>Over __many a **quaint** and **curious** volume__ of forgotten lore</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><p>Over <i>many a <b>quaint</b> and <b>curious</b> volume</i> of forgotten lore</p></result>
  <h3><a id="strikethrough"></a>Strikethrough</h3>
  <p>Any parts of text enclosed on either side by double tildes (<inline-code>~~</inline-code>) is considered
to be struck through. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>Nameless here for ~~never~~ evermore.</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><p>Nameless here for <strikethrough>never</strikethrough> evermore.</p></result>
  <h3><a id="placeholders"></a>Placeholders</h3>
  <p>A sequence of three or more underscores (<inline-code>___</inline-code>) is considered a placeholder. For
example:</p>
  <code><pre>Nameless here for __________.</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><p>Nameless here for <placeholder></placeholder>.</p></result>
  <h3><a id="selections"></a>Selections</h3>
  <p>Any text following double less-than signs (<inline-code>&lt;&lt;</inline-code>) and up to double greater-than
signs (<inline-code>&gt;&gt;</inline-code>) is considered a "selection". For example:</p>
  <code><pre>Once upon a midnight dreary, &lt;&lt;while I pondered,&gt;&gt; weak and weary,</pre></code>
  <p>A selection does not do anything other than mark a section of text. Why would you
want to do that ? So macros can be applied to them.</p>
  <h2><a id="slots"></a>Slots</h2>
  <p>There is one more type of inline element which connects inline elements to
blocks: <b>slots</b>.</p>
  <p>Any text following double curly opening braces (<inline-code>{{</inline-code>), optionally followed by
whitespace, and up to double curly closing braces (<inline-code>}}</inline-code>), optionally preceded
by whitespace, is considered a "slot". For example:</p>
  <code><pre>Once upon a {{time}}</pre></code>
  <p>The text enclosed within the slot, minus any leading and trailing whitespace is
the slot's key. So, in the above example, the key is <inline-code>time</inline-code>.</p>
  <p>Slots are replaced by whatever text and/or blocks have been defined as the
value associated with that key. How do you associate values to keys ? Well,
through <a href="#dictionaries">dictionaries</a>, of course.</p>
  <p>Here is a simple example, showing the combination in action:</p>
  <code><pre>Quoth {{who}} "{{what}}."
    - who: the **Raven**
    - what: __Nevermore__</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><p>Quoth the <b>Raven</b> "<i>Nevermore</i>."</p></result>
  <h3><a id="slots-and-tables"></a>Slots and tables</h3>
  <p>How do you place multiple lines in a table ? How do you place a list in a
table ? How do you place a table in a table ? In DoubleDown the answer is
simple: <i>slots</i>.</p>

    | Ah, distinctly I remember        | it was in the bleak December;     |
    | And each separate dying ember    | wrought its ghost upon the floor. |
    | Eagerly I wished the morrow;     |  - vainly I had sought to borrow  |
    | From my books surcease of sorrow | - sorrow for the lost Lenore -    |
    | For the rare and radiant maiden  | whom the angels name Lenore -     |
    | Nameless here                    | for evermore.                     |</pre></code>

  <h2><a id="macros"></a>Macros</h2>
  <p>Macros are DoubleDown's extension points. Their meaning is not defined by
DoubleDown; only their syntax is. But you can think of them as procedures being
applied to (parts of) a DoubleDown document.</p>
  <h3><a id="syntax"></a>Syntax</h3>
  <p>Anything enclosed between an opening square bracket (<inline-code>[</inline-code>) and a closing
square bracket (<inline-code>]</inline-code>) is considered a macro. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>[link https://www.wikipedia.org/]</pre></code>
  <p>Anything between the square brackets gets separated into values by whitespace.
The first value (which is required) is the macro's name.</p>
  <h3><a id="scope"></a>Scope</h3>
  <p>What a macro applies to depends on where the macro appears in the text.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>If a macro appears as the sole element in a block, then it applies to any
blocks nested below that one. For example:</span><code><pre>[code dbldwn]
    &gt; * Apples
    &gt; * Oranges</pre></code><p>Here the macro <inline-code>code</inline-code> (with argument <inline-code>dbldwn</inline-code>) would apply to the list block
nested below it.</p><p>If there are no nested blocks, it is assumed that the macro can do its work
without any.</p></li>
    <li><span>If a macro appears in a block with other elements, then it applies to any
"selection" directly preceding it. For example:</span><code><pre>More on &lt;&lt;the author of the Raven&gt;&gt;[link TheRaven]
can easily be found online.</pre></code><p>Here the macro <inline-code>link</inline-code> applies to the text "the author of the Raven".</p><p>If there is no selection, it is assumed that the macro can do its work without
one.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a id="including-other-doubledown-files"></a>Including other DoubleDown files</h3>
  <p>The <inline-code>include</inline-code> macro allows including the contents of a separate DoubleDown file
into the current one. The document tree which was built for the referenced file
will replace the macro.</p>
  <p>For example, say that there exists a file named <inline-code>the_raven.dbl.txt</inline-code> with the
following contents:</p>
  <code><pre>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
Only this and nothing more.”</pre></code>
  <p>We could reference that file from another, as in the following example:</p>
  <code><pre># The Raven

  [include the_raven.dbl.txt]</pre></code>
  <p>This would be equivalent to:</p>
  <code><pre># The Raven

  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
  “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
  Only this and nothing more.”</pre></code>
  <p>Note that the included file adheres to the nesting of the macro, as indicated
by the indentation.</p>
  <p>File references are resolved relative to the path of the file declaring the
inclusion.</p>
  <h3><a id="macro-modules"></a>Macro modules</h3>
  <p>The list of available macros may be expanded by third party modules, which can
be loaded in on-demand by means of the <inline-code>use</inline-code> macro. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>[use bibliography]</pre></code>
  <p>This would load the <inline-code>bibliography</inline-code> module, which will install extra macros for
use. For instance, this module defines a <inline-code>see</inline-code> macro which may be used to refer
to books.</p>
  <code><pre>Upon close reading of &lt;&lt;The Raven&gt;&gt;[see POE p.42]...</pre></code>
  <p>Now, this would look for any <inline-code>see</inline-code> macro. If multiple modules were to define
this macro then it may not be clear which one will actually be used. That's why
you can also scope macros with the module name:</p>
  <code><pre>Upon close reading of &lt;&lt;The Raven&gt;&gt;[bibliography see POE p.42]...</pre></code>
  <h2><a id="escaping-characters"></a>Escaping characters</h2>
  <p>Any character preceded by a backslash (<inline-code>\</inline-code>) will not be matched against any of
the markers checked for by DoubleDown. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>\# The Raven</pre></code>
  <p>Becomes:</p>
  <result><p># The Raven</p></result>
  <p>The escaped character will be passed as-is to the document, with the backslash
removed. For example:</p>
  <code><pre>\N\e\v\e\r\m\o\r\e</pre></code>
  <p>This will yield the same as:</p>
  <code><pre>Nevermore</pre></code>
  <p>If you need a backslash in your document, just escape it:</p>
  <code><pre>\\</pre></code>
</body>
</html>
